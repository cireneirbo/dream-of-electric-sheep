A web service that notifies users of their specified cryptocurrencies when a significant change in value is detected.  


No more are the sleep-deprived nights of the weary crypto-investor! 
With alerts indicating user-specified percentage changes over a declared time-frame, you can finally sleep soundly knowing you will be informed if a major breakout occurs. 
Unfortunately, in order to use this service, you must admit to being an android.. :P
